<h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
<p>A hero is someone who demonstrates courage, selflessness, and a willingness to fight for what is right, often at personal cost. In the case of Spider-Man (Peter Parker), he embodies these traits in several ways. He uses his powers to protect his city and its citizens, despite the personal sacrifices it often demands.</p>
<p>"With great power comes great responsibility." This sense of responsibility and his determination to make the world a better place, even when it's difficult or dangerous for him, defines Spider-Man as a true hero.</p>
